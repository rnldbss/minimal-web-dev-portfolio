This directory contains two different Portable Text for rendering rich text:

**MyPortableTextWithTOC.astro**

This generates IDs for headings. This component is specifically used in project pages where table of contents is needed.

**MyPortableText.jsx**

Used in React components where Astro components can't be rendered and everywhere else that a table of content is not needed.
